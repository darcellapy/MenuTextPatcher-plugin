# EasyAllMessageMod
Easy way to patch AllMessage.szs with your own.

AllMessage.szs is a file that contains all of the Wii U Menu text, being made up of **many** .msbt and .brfes files. This plugin lets you patch it with your whatever one you provide in a folder called `customtxts` at the root of your SD card (`SD:/customtxts/AllMessage.szs`). It's a easy gateway to replacing text in the Wii U Menu!
